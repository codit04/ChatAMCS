    "in_brief": "Dr.M.Senthil Kumar is a Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Comput. Sciences, PSG College of Technology.   He has got Post Doctoral fellowship from the Department of Nanobio Materials and Electronics, (WCU), Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology(GIST), Gwangju, S. Korea under the guidance of Prof. Khosrow Sohraby, Curators Professor, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri- Kansas City during 2010-2011.  He has been visiting GIST as Visiting Professor during the vacation period. Over 20 years of teaching and research experience, his research aimed to incorporate complex traffic patterns in analytic and simulation models. Additionally, he has experience in machine learning and federated learning, which has broadened his perspective and provided new insights into the potential of artificial intelligence in data privacy and security. One of his recent research areas is the Age of Information, which is a novel metric for evaluating the freshness of information in communication systems.  He served as an Associate Editor of Computers and Electrical Engineering (Elsevier Journal) from 2017 to 2019.",
